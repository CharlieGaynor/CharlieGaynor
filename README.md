- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CharlieGaynor
- Iâ€™m interested in Machine learning, Data science and more generally all things python! 
- I'm currently working as a data scientist full time, whilst working on side projects in my free time.
- The current project is a dutch card game (boerenbridge), alongside a trained A.I to show us how to play properly!
- Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on ML projects (could be an exciting kaggle competiton or anything else)
- Reach me on linkedin.com/in/CharlieGaynor, or CharlieJackGaynor@gmail.com
