- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CharlieGaynor
- Iâ€™m interested in Machine learning, Data science and more generally all things python! 
- I'm currently working as a data scientist full time, whilst working on side projects in my free time.
- Iâ€™m always looking to collaborate on ML projects (could be an exciting kaggle competiton or anything else), pygame, Javascript/django/flask (No experience yet but I want to learn!)
- Reach me on linkedin.com/in/CharlieGaynor, or CharlieJackGaynor@gmail.com
